# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This website is a day scehduler that is used for scheduling your activities throughout your day. It should save to local storage and the information remain on the page, but I am unable to get that part to work. To use this website simply scroll to find the time of day that you would like to enter in scheduling information and select the save button on the right side of that row. 

## Installation
The webpage uses the installation of dayjs which is a link that consists of the date format. 


## Usage
This webpage is used as a day scheduler. You can enter and save information that pertains to your daily schedule.
